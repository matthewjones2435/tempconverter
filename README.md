## Its Rude Its Crude But Its Here.
this is super basic level, I am sure that it can be done in a cleaner way (setting up methods etc for calculations) but I just hope this can 
help by reducing the amount of time needed to make it the way any of you would prefer, its only a main activiy, with xml, things are constrained to 
eachother and the main activity is basically just the edit texts for input, and six on click listeners for the buttons so they may do thier corresponding work


## What to watch out for 

If we do need to create this from a project that has no activity be sure to add into the manifest.xml the inent filter 

it should look like the manifest that is in this project (i tried to copy and paste it but it would not display)


We will also need to change the layout of the objects according to his specifications 

the computed results display a ton of decimal places we will probally need to format this to show only a few decimal places 

## What Does work 

All of the calculations are correct, all of the text edits will allow signed number input, all of the buttons display the correct calculations above the 
corresponding edit text, edit texts have hints 
temperature values and displays are coded with the unicode value for the degree symbol, keyboard pushes view objets and resizes them so all will display
while keyboard is visible.
